V11:  Change the self-test phase to accept antibodies which match on normal
      provided the number of normal traffic instances that the antibodies 
      labeled attacks fall beneath a threshold of 0.0001 (0.01%) or 1 instance,
      whichever is greater, of the total number of traffic instances.

      Increased precision by 1 on false_pos and false_neg outputs

      Added output of absolute false_pos and false_neg numbers

V12:  Baseline of the new output format. Set threshold to 0 to emulate the
      old (v10 and lower) self-test routine to get absolute counts of the
      missed requests instead of just percentages.

V13:  Change training phase to only mark request as attack if X or more
      antibodies mark the request as an attack. X is passed as a command
      line parameter.

      Changed self-test threshold to command line parameter. 

      Output value of self-test threshold and training phase X to summary.

V14:  Added labels to antibodies to do rudimentary classification.

V15:  Added more summarized output about classifications.
