make all in the root (this) directory. the 'dhs' executable and the 'retrieve' exe under the retdir directory should have been created.
under the ais directory and run 'lifetime.xxxx'. this should result in a 'champions.abs' file being created.
run 'dhs' to begin capturing network traffic, then run 'retdir/retrieve' to start the retrieve component. analyzed traffic is logged in 'traffic.log'
if you wish to update/change the antibody pool ('champions.abs'), run 'lifetime.xxxx'. send a SIGUSR1 signal to the retrieve process to initiate an update ('pkill -SIGUSR1 retrieve').
updates are handeled by pausing processing of and queueing up incoming traffic while replacing champions pool, so nothing should be lost.
