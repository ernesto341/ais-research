Versions numbered.
Current Stable Version: 0.2

With version 0.2 and later, just run make to create all necessary binaries. Ver. 0.3 and later include a 'make veryclean' and a 'make clean' option, removing everything or just logs and dhs/retrieve binaries respectively.

Setup:

Run 'make veryclean', then 'make'.
Run 'lifetime.25' (or whichever version desired) from the 'ais/' directory. 'champions.abs' should be created.

Useage:

Run 'dhs -i <interface>', optionally with ' 2> dhs.log &' to begin monitoring network traffic.
Run 'retrieve' from the 'retdir/' directory, optionally with ' 2> ret.log &' to begin testing live traffic.
Live traffic test results are stored in 'traffic.log'.
To update the 'champions.abs' file with a new pool of antibodies, rerun 'lifetime.25' (or whichever version makes you happiest) from the 'ais/' directory. A new 'champions.abs' file will be created. After the new pool has been bred, send a SIGUSR1 signal to the 'retrieve' process. The new pool will be imported, replacing the old pool.
To exit cleanly, kill the 'retrieve' process. All other processes will exit, cleaning up after themselves.
